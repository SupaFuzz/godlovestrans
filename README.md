*a real simple website with a real simple purpose and not a whole lot more.*

The world needs a website that unambiguously, and loudly states that transgender people are loved by God. Not in that usual "yeah but your sin and the cross and yadda yadda yadda" way, but in the **God made you this way on purpose and is HERE FOR   IT** kinda way

When I look around the internet, and the religious scene, I'm not getting a lot of that. What I do find, is usually wrapped in a larger message of LGBTQ+ affirmation. That is beautiful and necessary, but if you're trans you already know. Our thing is similar, but totally different. The issues that make us distinct from our LGBQ+ siblings are monstrous and terrifying.

**We need to be spoken to directly** -- and that is why I was led to do this.

## SO WHAT IS IT, EXACTLY?

Well let me start by just saying what is isn't.

* It's not a blog
* It's not an "online community"
* There will be no liking, commenting or subscribing
* There will positively be no fundraising or money asks of any kind. Ever.

I'm open to evolving the idea for sure, but initially what I have in mind is this, a site with:

* A piece written by a pastor, to a trans person searching the internet for reassurance they arent going to hell.
* A collection of outside resources: books, talks, support groups, lists of therapists, affirming churches, etc.

That's it, that's the *entire* idea. In a nutshell: **a lighthouse for my kind** -- to let us know we are loved in no uncertain terms, and point the direction to where more help lies.



## I NEED YOUR HELP

Are you a pastor? Better yet are you a *transgender pastor*? Out or not, you have a priceless message inside of you, even without words, it is *incarnate in your very physical existence*. But maybe if you DO have words, write them down! Because now you have a place to put it on the internet, anonymously if you wish.

I'd like to swap out the "letter to you from a pastor" section once a month (or maybe more frequently if that volume of material emerges from the community). The reason isn't to keep the site fresh. The reason is to reflect as many different perspectives as possible. There are an infinite variety of us out there, and we need to have an infinite number of styles, and perspectives to get that message through to every single one of us that comes looking.

Do you know of more links than the pathetic 4 or 5 links I scraped off the top of my head? I need those too.

Do you run a support group? Do you have an affirming church? Does your church have a trans outreach? Send me your links. They belong here.


## CRITERIA FOR SUBMISSIONS

If you're going to write for the site, I do ask that you can prove that you know what you're talking about. You don't *need* to be a pastor, but you've got to have had some bonafide education in the pastorish areas of theology and counseling.

Here's why: *you're gonna have to know how **not** to say things that might make people want to kill themselves* That is something, I can guarantee you, we are going to run into quite often round these parts.

Posts can be anonymous, but part of the responsibility of writing here is making yourself available to people in crisis and pain who might read what you wrote here and need to reach out (an insta, or a twitter handle, or an email address, or a facebook ... something).


## YEAH OK, BUT YOUR SITE LOOKS LIKE GEOCITIES, YO

LOL. you aren't wrong. This whole thing is like 10 minutes old. I know how to make it good for sure. I've been writing sites and apps for nearly 30 years. Long story short is that I'm in the middle of finishing a different project for work. Once that's done in the next few weeks, this project will get the sustained attention it needs to look the part.

I don't feel comfortable writing about it publicly, but suffice it to had a *religious experience* of some kind that laid the very small responsibility of engineering this and getting it running on my shoulders. I can't tell you how, but I know this responsibility is mine, and as it so happens ... while writing the content isn't something I'm qualified to do, building a site for it sure is.
