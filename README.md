# GODLOVESTRANS.ORG

*a real simple website with a real simple purpose and not a whole lot more.*

The world needs a website that unambiguously, and loudly states that transgender people are loved by God. Not in that usual "yeah but your sin and the cross and yadda yadda yadda" way, but in the **God made you this way on purpose and is HERE FOR   IT** kinda way

When I look around the internet, and the religious scene, I'm not getting a lot of that. What I do find, is usually wrapped in a larger message of LGBTQ+ affirmation. That is beautiful and necessary, but if you're trans you already know. Our thing is similar, but totally different. The issues that make us distinct from our LGBQ+ siblings are monstrous and terrifying.

**We need to be spoken to directly** -- and that is why I was led to do this.

## SO WHAT IS IT, EXACTLY?

Well let me start by just saying what it isn't.

* It's not a blog (in the traditional sense anyhow)
* It's not an "online community"
* There will positively be no fundraising or money asks of any kind. Ever.


* **There will be no liking, commenting or subscribing**

    Here's what I mean by that. Though we may end up adding very rudamentary subscription methods, such as RSS and email subscription (eventually), the main thing this site is *not*, is a way to "build an audience", for you, your book, your podcast, your album, your church etc. If you're making money off it, it does not belong here (I'm sure there are exceptions to this rule, but that's the general ethos of what we're building here).

    This site is meant to be a voice of love in the darkness. Being popular, attracting clicks and views and getting twitter mentions, etc ... those things are not important toward that goal (though of course, validation is *always nice*).

    Making sure this voice is available whenever and wherever a trans person is in crisis and thinks they're on the outs with God because of who they are ... even if we get three hits a year and one of them is you and one of them is me ... it's still worth it, and that is the point of this project.


I'm open to evolving the idea for sure, but initially, here's what we've got going

* Articles published in chunks, once a month because I have a day job ...

* Articles, written by you. With yourself in mind, the first time you had the guts to type "transgender" into google. What would you say to yourself? What were you hoping to find. Write that. I mean it doesn't need to be "dear me ten years ago", but that's a starter.

* Of those articles, at least one piece written by a pastor, to a trans person searching the internet for reassurance they aren't going to hell.

* You don't have to be trans to contribute, but having trans contributors is very important. A huge part of this outreach is *reflection*. Meaning that there is no substitute for seeing your own reflection in your faith. It is important for transgender pastors to be visible to transgender people. Every day. At every opportunity. That's another reason for this site.

* A collection of outside resources: books, talks, support groups, lists of therapists, affirming churches, etc.

That's it, that's the *entire* idea. In a nutshell: **a lighthouse for my kind** -- to let us know we are loved in no uncertain terms, and point the direction to where more help lies.



## I NEED YOUR HELP

Are you a pastor? Better yet are you a *transgender pastor*? Out or not, you have a priceless message inside of you, even without words, it is *incarnate in your very physical existence*. But maybe if you DO have words, write them down! Because now you have a place to put it on the internet, anonymously if you wish.

Do you know of more links than the pathetic 4 or 5 links I scraped off the top of my head? I need those too.

Do you run a support group? Do you have an affirming church? Does your church have a trans outreach? Send me your links. They belong here.


## CRITERIA FOR SUBMISSIONS

If you're going to write for the site, I do ask that you can prove that you know what you're talking about. You don't *need* to be a pastor, but you've got to have had some bonafide education in the pastorish areas of theology and counseling.

Here's why: *you're gonna have to know how **not** to say things that might make people want to kill themselves* That is something, I can guarantee you, we are going to run into quite often round these parts.

Posts can be anonymous, but part of the responsibility of writing here is making yourself available to people in crisis and pain who might read what you wrote here and need to reach out (an insta, or a twitter handle, or an email address, or a facebook ... something).


## YEAH OK, BUT YOUR SITE DESIGN ... OH HONEY ...

it could be better. Though I've spent a whole lot of my career writing sites and mobile apps, and in fact, another world and another time and another gig, I did consider myself somewhat the visual design geek ... visual design skills are rusty on this end, putting it mildly. Hey it's github. Make a pull request, if you want. We can make this thing better together, and I'm all in for that :-)
