                        This morning I was watching <a class="highlight" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PastorJune/featured">Pastor June Joplin’s</a> most recent YouTube update on her life and ministry
                         and she mentioned that there are transgender people who are Christian, sometimes to the shock and dismay of others
                     </p>

                    <p>
                        She, as a transgender woman, is also a pastor who publicly came out in a message and in short order was fired from her church.
                        Thankfully she found an amazing opportunity to minister again through MCC-Toronto.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Going back to that idea of being both transgender and christian. There are a lot of people, and I mean A LOT of people, who
                        believe that ne’er the twain shall meet. In other words, you cannot be both transgender and also be a christian in their mind.
                        These are the same people that have such a small box for their god that they have already ruled that anyone who falls into the
                        spectrum of being LGBTQ+ is obviously “lost” and their souls are endangered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For me, growing up with a religious background, this worried me. When I found personal faith as an 18 year old college student
                        I hoped that faith would not only save me but also “fix” me or “heal” me of what I had assumed was a perversion or sin. Those
                        ideas weren’t natural, they were sadly forced upon into my mind through years of evangelical preaching and teaching.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">I’ll be honest, I really thought in order for me to be transgender I would have to totally kick my faith to the curb.</span>
                        Be it the catholic church I grew up in, or the baptist church I found myself in later in life; I didn’t see where christian faith
                        and being transgender could ever survive. It probably didn’t help that the few times I came across someone who was transgender
                        while growing up in the 70’s and 80’s, usually in the media, they weren’t presented in a way that proclaimed “God loves me as
                        I am.” Honestly, it was usually because they were taught that God hates them.

                        When I was in seminary in the mid 90’s I was finding my way around the growing World Wide Web and as a result exploring things
                        that I had thought and felt most of my growing years. That is also when I discovered a new to me term, it was “transgender.”
                        That one made a lot more sense to me than the terms I heard growing up. One was <span class="highlight">“transsexual”</span> which made me think that that who
                        I was all about who I wanted to sleep with. The other was <span class="highlight">“transvestite”</span> which I heard as a kid in the early and mid 1970’s and
                        even to my unknowing ears it sounded derogatory at best.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bigQuote">
                        But <span class="highlight">transgender</span>, that made sense to me.

                    <p>
                        Gender being the societal norms of male and female that we were taught and ingrained in
                        us. In elementary school the boys played here and the girls played there. In middle school the boys played football and the girls
                        did cheer or dance, maybe volleyball. In high school the boys had their locker room and the girls had theirs. And of course there
                        was always those dress codes which seemed to favor keeping the boys and their raging hormones under control at the expense of the
                        comfort of the girls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I didn’t have to do much research back then to realize that transgender is what I was, it is who I am. When I did my first
                        round of gender therapy online in 2019 it was only confirmed, along with gender dysphoria. I wish I could say I accepted
                        myself at that time, but it was still a work in progress that I’m still working on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Around the same time, in the mid 90’s, when I discovered what being transgender meant I began to explore the idea of being
                        trans and also being a christian. Could I really follow the Jesus who I trusted when I was 18 and still be transgender? Could
                        God love me if I would eventually pursue transition or would I have to keep that side of me stuffed in a closet and pray that
                        it never comes out? Thankfully I found my answer through Yahoo Groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oh, I’m so dating myself here, aren’t I? Some of us remember the Yahoo Groups, set up similar to groups you find on Facebook
                        now, except it was through the Yahoo web service. It was in Yahoo Groups I found a group called <span class="highlight">“Transgender Christians”</span>,
                        organized by a woman who is trans herself, but also actively involved in her local church…an evangelical church if I recall
                        correctly of all places! I recently messaged her to thank her for that early work she did because it might have helped save
                        my life more than once.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the next 15-20 years I would find myself entering and exiting that group as I tried to accept myself as transgender and
                        then allow guilt and shame to lead me to a purge of those things that helped me find wholeness. And every time I went back in,
                        there was a sense of acceptance by those who like me struggled to reconcile to the two, but hung on to faith none the less.

                        Isn’t that what a church should be like any way? We come together, unite with our struggles and find someone in common that builds
                        our faith.
                    </p>

                        I’ll be honest, if it weren’t for the deconstruction of my strong evangelical, borderline calvinist views of faith, I might not
                        be where I am today in terms of self acceptance. I hated myself for being transgender and didn’t see how I can truly call myself a
                        “christian” by letting that “sin of being transgender” define me. But once those theological blinders came off and grace became
                        more of a reality to me, I rediscovered a faith that is stronger today than ever.

                        I am Danielle Grace, and <span class="highlight">I am a transgender woman and I am a follower of Jesus.</span> Accepting myself as the previous has grown me in the

                        And it is in that faith I believe the words I read in Romans 8:37-39 to be true:

                        neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, <br><br><sup>39</sup> neither height nor depth, nor anything else in

                        My hope and my faith is built on that love that says God loves me so much that They were willing to wrap Themselves in flesh and

                    <p class="miniQuote">Last night I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/tk_CqGVfxEs">Pray Away</a>, a documentary which thouroughly examined the history of a popular conversion therapy ministry.</p>

                    <p>
                        The film follows several figures and their lives/involvement with the ministry and others like it. This isn't a film review or analysis, and will contain no spoilers and little direct reference.
                        <span class="lowlight">I can't begin to describe how closely I related to almost every person involved</span>, including the hurt and humiliation associated with such toxic so called theology
                        that does untold harm regardless of misguided intentions. <span class="highlight">I believed for many years that I was under what I perceived as being God's righteous judgement as due punishment
                        for dabbling in my true authentic self.</span> I truly thought that my divorce, depression, and other various struggles in life were a direct result of both exploring my gender identity and openly
                        affirming lgbtq people. I was convinced that the only remedy was to run in the opposite direction, and embrace the image of masculinity I had been told would save me. It's a good thing I never got
                        involved in a group like Exodus, as I can only imagine the self hate and damage I would have continued to wreak upon myself bit possibly others.

                    <p>
                        Instead I retreated into an internal crusade of self hate mostly from a distance. I would listen to transphobic, anti gay sermons and truly believed it made me more holy. As someone who began their faith journey as a liberal sixteen year old, I slowly descended into a more fundamentalist, less inclusive mindset which I perceived as truth. Anyone who disagreed was heretical and enslaved to the world.
                    </p>
                    <p class="miniQuote">
                        I say with deep shame and a sincere universal policy that I found myself becoming angry when I saw gay couples or anyone displaying even the slightest hint of gender non-conformity. If a queer person was featured on a tv show, I would storm out of the room.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thankfully my former church never organized any kind of conversion therapy groups that I know of. Still, you heard the same ideas and hurtful comments thrown around occasionally in studies and sermons.
                        There was this sense of urgency to protect what they saw as traditional biblical families. I myself was convinced that if I was able to start a new family, allbeit blended, that all of these things I
                        think I needed and wanted would fall into place. I nearly made that mistake, having an engagement fall to pieces shortly before I came to peace with the truth that <span class="highlight">my God given identity were a gift to
                        be embraced.</span> Until then, I was convinced that being trans and queer was a sinful side of me that needed to be repressed and avoided just as much as my drinking.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bigQuote">
                        However, unlike my alcoholism, being LGBTQ
                        wasn't sinful or self destructive. Instead, <span class="highlight">denying that truth did untold harm</span> to my mental health and capacity to love and care for others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In early 2020 I stopped believing I was inherently wicked and as a result of this toxic theology assumed my faith was just as dead as my birth name. I was astonished at how wrong I was.
                        Queer people of faith came out of the woodwork to support me. I met so many believing trans people through a church fb group, many of which came from a similar spiritual background.
                        <span class="highlight">I had no idea how many queer people identified as Christians</span>, nor how many straight, cis believers were out there enthusiastically offering their kindness and affirmations. I learned
                        about how certain scriptures have been mistranslated, misinterpreted, and misused throughout the years, and the new wave of inclusion sweeping churches of various denominations.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bigQuote">
                        My faith,
                        far from dead, is being renewed daily by a loving God who has purpose for my life in the authentic way it was meant to be lived.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've had the opportunity to help out with worship music and have been interviewed by churches working towards inclusion. Beyond ministry opportunities I've been blessed with rich, meaningful fellowship with others on a similar path.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I really don't know what more I could say about this film, other than it was incredibly powerful and at times hard to watch. I believe everyone should see it, whether they identify as LGBTQ, Christian, both, or anywhere in between. It's important to understand how harmful and in some instances even deadly this type of practice is, no matter how loving and kindhearted it's portrayed to be. It would be incredibly difficult for anyone to remain skeptical about the damage done by these kinds of programs after watching this film. Conversion therapy is a lie from the pit of hell, one which continues to manifest itself across churches and individuals without regard for the needless suffering it produces.

                        <span class="lowlight">Superfluous</span><br><br>
                        ADJECTIVE<br>
                        Something that is superfluous is unnecessary or is no longer needed.<br><br>
                        &quot;My presence at the afternoon's proceedings was <span class="lowlight">superfluous</span>.&quot;
                    </p>

                    <p class="miniQuote">Born almost sixty years ago into the body of a stranger named Diane, I spent a lot of time presenting and pretending to be female.
                    It was exhausting and unnatural, though looking back I may have deserved an Emmy.</p>

                    <p class="bigQuote">
                        I can hear the announcer bellowing my award:<br><br>
                        "For his role as Diane, the Emmy goes to Declan DeWitt Hall!"<br><br>
                        <span class="highlight">The crowd cheers and I cry inside.</span>
                    </p>


                    <p>As we get older we're taught that pretending is supposed to be tossed to the side. Well, let me tell you my pile of pretending
                    was pretty high.</p>

                    <p>Just for fun let's call my gender identity "deckles." Diane was bursting from the seams with deckles. I was like a wet dog
                    shaking off and everyone was getting splashed with deckles. Oddly, no one admitted to noticing. They enabled my pretense
                    despite being soaked by my deckleness. To this day many people who have known me my whole life would say they never saw
                    my transitioning coming. They refuse to see Declan.</p>

                    <p class="lowlight">People only see what they want to see or what we permit them to see.</p>

                    <p>Little did I know twelve years ago that was all about to change when I met my beloved Suzanne in church. She saw ME.</p>

                    <p>An odd thing happens when someone loves you so much they only want what is best for you;
                    <span class="highlight">you are free to be fully and totally you.</span>
                    Declan still hides behind Diane some days but that's because of the world outside our home.</p>

                    <p class="bigQuote">I am on a journey as we all are. It's called <span class="lowlight">becoming</span>.<br><br><span class="highlight">We were all loved into being by the Divine</span>, and then watered and grown
                    through more love.</p>

                    <p>Diane is becoming superfluous, which opens the door for Declan to be supercalifragilistic. May you meet people who see you,
                    welcome you, and encourage you to be fully your supercalifragilistic amazing self!</p>

                        ourselves and our conerns (that is, the experiene of trans people of faith) seems somehow inappropriate, perhaps.
                        But then we really don't have the choice do we? It's not like we can wake up in the morning and just wish our trans away.

                        talk, she draws a parallel between the leaves of Adam and Eve hiding themselves from God in the book
                        of Genesis to those "leaves" we cover our insecurities with in every day life ... and she advises
                        to burn them.

                        Until next time, I want to leave you with a poem of sorts that I wrote in a difficult moment,
                        world seemingly crashing down around me, one very stressed and dysphoric evening in early July:
                    </p>


<p class="poetry">
<span class="highlight">Transition is a fire</span>,
clearing the way
for the most durable tree in the forest
to bloom and grow without limit.

The part of you that remains
is the part of you that <span class="highlight">cannot be destroyed</span>.

That soul in you
that always was, and always will be.

The now burnt forest in you,
is what any passing tourist
would have said that you were

<span class="highlight">before</span>

because in those moments, to them ...
<span class="highlight">you actually were</span>.

When they paused in awe,
your majestic oaks,
the flocks of birds in your branches,
the moss and the dandelions and the flowers,

<span class="highlight">you heard them and you believed them</span>.

Though you knew it wasn’t the best part of you

— the most durable part —

it was beautiful.
And you wanted that for yourself.

<span class="highlight">So, now that it’s all gone to ash.</span>

There is the now present, and forever longed for
<span class="highlight">beauty of unfettered life</span>.

And there is grief
for the <span class="highlight">lost illusions</span>.

And there is the constant learning and relearning.

<span class="highlight">“I was never the forest
    I was the strongest tree in it”</span>
