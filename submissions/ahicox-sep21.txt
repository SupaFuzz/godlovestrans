I still don't know what I'm doing

When I launched this project back in February, we were just shy of a year into COVID-19
lockdown. One month shy, in fact. We have lost so much, and so many since then. I can't
begin put words to it.

    there is a light we can't always see
    if there is a world we can't always be
    there is a dark we shouldn't doubt
    there is a light, don't let it go out

As I said before, I didn't know what I was doing then, and I sure as shit don't know
what I'm doing now.

Lately, I find myself seriously questioning whether I still consider myself Christian, and
not because I'm having second thoughts about Christ. Because I'm having second thoughts about
what the word 'christian' means, practically speaking, in the universe of the Deep South of
the United States in the year 2021.

To many is seems to mean vaccine conspiracy theories, refusing to wear a mask, acting the fool
at school board meetings, mocking and belittling people who work on medical frontlines, risking
their own lives to manage emergency rooms crammed with hoards of jackasses who refuse to take a
vaccine that they can get for free and that the entire world stopped for more than a whole year
to give them ... all that, and using the funhouse mirror version of Jesus they've constructed
to justify it all.

as if.

This is not a version of "faith" that leads to anything but death and destruction and any
reasonable person would walk far far away from that ignorance.

For the past few months, I've had a nagging at the back of my mind. <i>just take the
site down, let it go</i>. Maybe this was just one of the many, many embarrassing stages of my
transition. Hey it happens, man. Doing a second pass at puberty in your mid-fourties is just
exactly as cringeworthy as you might imagine.

but then ...

Transition is a fire, clearing the way for the most durable tree in the forest to bloom and grow without limit. The part of you that remains is the part of you that cannot be destroyed. That soul in you that always was, and always will be.
The now burnt forest in you, is what any passing tourist would have said that you were before, because in those moments, to them, you actually were.
When they paused in awe your majestic oaks, the flocks of birds in your branches, the moss and the dandelions and the flowers, you heard them and you believed them. Though you knew it wasn’t the best part of you — the most durable part — it was beautiful. And you wanted that for yourself.
So, now that it’s all gone to ash.
There is the now present, and forever longed for beauty of unfettered life. And there is grief for the lost illusions. And there is the constant learning and relearning.
“I wasn’t the forest, I was the strongest tree in it”
